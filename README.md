# Employee Management System

## Problem Statement
To create a web application with REST API endpoints that allow CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on employee and department data.

## Key Features

### User Roles
Our system intelligently categorizes users into distinct roles, offering tailored views and permissions for each:

- **Employees**: Access their own data, update personal details, and view assigned tasks.
- **Managers**: In addition to employee privileges, they can assign tasks and manage teams.
- **Super Users**: Enjoy full access to the system, overseeing all aspects.

### Task Assignment
Managers and Super Users can efficiently allocate tasks related to projects to employees.

### Manager Selection
Identify and designate potential managers from your pool of eligible employees.

### Support Ticket System
Employees can raise a query or a feedback.
